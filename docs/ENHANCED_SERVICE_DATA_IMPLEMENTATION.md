# Enhanced Service Data Implementation

## Overview

Successfully integrated enhanced service data structure to eliminate keyword stuffing and provide valuable, data-driven content for service pages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Service Interface (`src/lib/data.ts`)

- `localExpertise` - Common issues, code requirements, permit process
- `technicalDetails` - Voltage, amperage, code compliance
- `cta` - Call-to-action text for estimates and contact

### 2. Enhanced ServiceInformation Component (`src/components/ServiceInformation.astro`)

Completely redesigned to display:
- **Service Specifications** - Duration, complexity, permits, warranty in a grid

One thing he does that other electricians dont is he uses the diagnostic charge towards your repair if a repair is needed. Not many are this honest and his prices are much more fair compared to the competition. He is forsure my go to Ev charger technician from now on. Keep up the good work!",

He diagnosed the panel and suggested I do a panel upgrade. He flipped the breakers and found one of them arcing with a little flame.  He said he could not leave with electricity connected because of the fire risk. He said he would go home and write up a quote and email it to me that night. His price was so much lower than the quotes I had for a panel replacement.  I agreed to have this done and he said he would order the parts Friday night and pick up the parts Saturday morning and be at my house to do the job around 10:00am.He was here on time and got to work. It took him till about 3:30-4:00pm to complete the job.I highly recommend First Electric for all  your electrical needs.Honest, friendly, and does what he says he will do??MarkBrea CA",

We scheduled an appointment for the following day. He showed up at the precise scheduled time and thoroughly inspected the project and gave me a detailed plan on what was needed. After evaluating several other companies, I decided to go with Michael. His wasn't the most expensive nor cheapest but his professionalism helped make my decision.He pulled the permit and contacted Edison before starting the job. About a week later we scheduled an appointment for installation, most of which was completed the first day. He came back the next to finish up a few things (cleaning the area each day.) He scheduled his patch & repair person in the following days and the final inspection. My only complaint would be that his patch & repair person was not as meticulous about cleaning the area after he finished his job. Otherwise, from start to finish I am pleased with the outcome. I told Michael he's my electrician for life now!! Don't hesitate in hiring him - you won't be disappointed.",

He had a competitive quote, showed up and was great at troubleshooting a rather complex issue while taking the time to explain why/how he was troubleshooting the way he was. He was able to resolve the issue and I'll be reaching out to him for future electrical needs.",
